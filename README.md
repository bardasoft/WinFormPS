# WinFormPS

If you are among those creating PowerShell User Interface using PowerShell Studio from SAPIEN, you will realize the big need for functions to interact with the different WinForms Controls.

I started to share a couple of functions I use in my script and hope to see some people contribute to this repo.

# Installation
To install in your personal modules folder (e.g. ~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules), run:
